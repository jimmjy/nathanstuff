      "We have enjoyed Cleenup services for housekeeping over the last 2 years and are extremely happy with the quality, reliability and flexibility of work tasks performed.  We have allergies and Cleenup takes extra care in meticulous dusting of all services.  Given our very busy work schedules, we depend on their consistent and reliable presence in our home to make it a clean and relaxed environment upon our return.  They offer additional services such as light gardening and catering services for events which make their presence invaluable for busy career driven people.  We recommend their services with full confidence.   You will be impressed."

      "CleenUp have saved my sanity this last year.  There just weren't enough hours in the day for this full time student and mother of two and part time teacher and her partner (think the absent minded professor).  CleenUp show up unfailingly cheerful and leave things organized and sparkling clean. They have also been helpful around special events/vacations and are open to receiving varied instructions according to our needs at the time.  I have already recommended them to family members and friends, and all have been very pleased! Don't delay, call today!"
